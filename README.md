## GoPacket Experiments

Once upon a time, I tried to learn how to use gopacket by reading its [examples](https://github.com/google/gopacket/tree/master/examples). However, they seemed too complex to me at the time. So I experimented with gopacket on my own, and these are the code I written to learn Go and understand how gopacket works. I published this repository years ago, and now it is to stay here for archival purposes.

## Build

Make sure `libpcap` is installed on your system. Then do `go build` on each directory.
